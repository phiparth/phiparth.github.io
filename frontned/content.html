      <strong><h1>üß©Basics of the Asian Parliamentary Format</h1></strong><br><br>

      The Asian Parliamentary (AP) format is one of the most common debate styles used in schools and colleges. It‚Äôs a team-based format with two sides:<br>
      ‚Ä¢ <strong>Government (Gov)</strong>: Supports the motion<br>
      ‚Ä¢ <strong>Opposition (Opp)</strong>: Opposes the motion<br><br>

      Each team has 3 speakers, and each person speaks for 7 minutes.<br>
      During a speech, members from the other team can offer Points of Information (POIs) between the 1st and 6th minute. These are short interjections or questions to challenge the speaker.<br><br>

      <strong><h1>EXAMPLES:</h1></strong><br>
      ________________________________________<br>
      <strong><h1>üèõÔ∏èMotion: This House would prioritize friends over romantic partners</h1></strong><br>
      <em>first ask user and then give this analysis</em><br>
      ________________________________________<br><br>

      ‚úÖ <strong>Government Case</strong><br>
      <strong>Principle:</strong> Friendships are deeper and more stable over time. Romantic relationships often fade or break, but friends offer lifelong support.<br>
      <strong>Practical:</strong> Friendships are plural and diverse. Prioritizing them prevents emotional overdependence on one partner. It creates a healthier, more balanced life.<br>
      <strong>Examples:</strong><br>
      ‚Ä¢ Friends stay through breakups.<br>
      ‚Ä¢ Many people feel more emotionally safe and open with friends.<br><br>

      ‚ùå <strong>Opposition Case</strong><br>
      <strong>Principle:</strong> Romantic relationships demand exclusivity and depth. Prioritizing others can break trust and emotional intimacy.<br>
      <strong>Practical:</strong> Building a life with a partner (marriage, kids, shared finances) needs prioritization. Friends are important, but can't offer the same long-term commitment.<br>
      <strong>Examples:</strong><br>
      ‚Ä¢ Partner may feel neglected if friends are always prioritized.<br>
      ‚Ä¢ Romantic bonds need effort and exclusivity to work.<br><br>

      üß† <strong>How to Think of Arguments</strong><br>
      1. Define the context: What does ‚Äúprioritize‚Äù mean? Time? Emotional commitment? Decision-making?<br>
      2. Identify the clash: Emotional health, loyalty, long-term stability.<br>
      3. Think stakeholders: How are friends affected? How is the partner affected?<br>
      4. Weigh values: Stability vs intimacy, diversity of bonds vs exclusivity, emotional safety vs commitment.<br><br>

      <em>Use real-life logic:</em><br>
      ‚Ä¢ Gov: ‚ÄúWho stays with you through life‚Äôs ups and downs?‚Äù<br>
      ‚Ä¢ Opp: ‚ÄúWho do you build your future with?‚Äù<br><br>

      <strong>Always ask:</strong> Why does this matter? To whom? In what context?<br><br>

      <strong><h1>üèõÔ∏èMotion: This House believes exes can be friends</h1></strong><br>
      ________________________________________<br><br>

      ‚úÖ <strong>Government Case</strong><br>
      <strong>Principle:</strong> Emotional connections don‚Äôt need to end just because romance does. If the breakup was respectful, a meaningful friendship can remain.<br>
      <strong>Practical:</strong> Exes often understand each other deeply. They can offer mature support, closure, and stability ‚Äî especially if they were important in each other‚Äôs lives.<br>
      <strong>Examples:</strong><br>
      ‚Ä¢ People co-parent after divorce and remain friends.<br>
      ‚Ä¢ Some breakups are mutual and end without bitterness.<br>
      <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Promotes emotional maturity, breaks toxic ‚Äúall or nothing‚Äù norms.<br><br>

      ‚ùå <strong>Opposition Case</strong><br>
      <strong>Principle:</strong> Romantic history creates emotional baggage. Staying friends confuses boundaries and prevents full closure.<br>
      <strong>Practical:</strong> One person may still have feelings. New partners may feel uncomfortable. It can lead to jealousy, drama, or emotional harm.<br>
      <strong>Examples:</strong><br>
      ‚Ä¢ Staying in touch delays moving on.<br>
      ‚Ä¢ One-sided friendships after breakups are common and painful.<br>
      <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Emotional clarity and clean breaks protect mental health and future relationships.<br><br>

      üß† <strong>How to Think of Arguments</strong><br>
      1. Define terms: What does ‚Äúbeing friends‚Äù look like? Regular contact? Emotional closeness?<br>
      2. Identify stakes: Emotional wellbeing, maturity, boundaries, future relationships.<br>
      3. Ask ‚Äòwhy‚Äô and ‚Äòwhat if‚Äô: Why would someone want this? What if one party still has feelings?<br>
      4. Compare impacts: Gov focuses on healthy emotional evolution; Opp on mental clarity and clean transitions.<br>
